\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

62 mechanical-turk trial results were analyzed, giving a total of 2480 moves.
For each move, the log probability assigned by the particle filter to the
categorization decision made by the human subject was recorded. The mean of these
$2480$ log probabilities was an unimpressive $-1379.256$, and the median was
$-29.612$.

The three histograms in figures \ref{fig:fullhist}, \ref{fig:smallhist}, and
\ref{fig:cumulativehist}, though, show that $48.9\%$ of the
log probabilities were greater than $-0.25$ and $51.5\%$ were greater than
$-1.0$. $1216$ moves saw the particle filter inference algorithm assigning
probabilities (\emph{not} log probabilities) greater than $0.5$ to the
categorization selected by the human, indicating that the particle filter model
used in this experiment agreed with the human data at least $49.032\%$ of the
time. The average move involved a choice between $4.929$ groups, making a
$20.286\%$ success rate equivalent to chance, and showing that the particle
filter performed far better than chance. Additionally, the average move for
which the particle filter agreed with human data involved a choice between
$4.258$ groups, allowing the conclusion that the particle filter performed only slightly
worse, on average, when presented with a decision between a high number of
groups.
