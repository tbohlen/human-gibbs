\section*{Experimental Design}

Describe how experiment chosen: balancing between a task natural for a person
and a task natural for a categorization algorithm in order to facilitate the
comparison.

Mechanical Turk users were subject of experiment; all movements of the images
were logged and stored for analysis.

  the 'Next Image' box into one of the groups. Once an image was placed in a
  group, it could not be switched into another group.  The subject was limited
  to creating 8 groups.}
