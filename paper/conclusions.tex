\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This experiment was designed to extend the previous work concerning particle
filters and category learning by Anderson, Sanborn, Griffeths, and Navarro by
comparing not just the results of Baysian machine categorization with human
categorization, but each move made during the categorization process. Such an
analysis has the potential to offer much stronger evidence for or against human
categorization models

68 subjects participated in the 40-image categorization test, and the particle
filter inference algorithm used agreed with the human choices $49.032\%$ of the
time. Chance would have resulted in a $20.286\%$ agreement rate.

Although not conclusive, the results do support the existing evidence that
Baysian models, and, in particular, particle filters are good potential models
for human categorization. Potentially more importantly, this study functioned as
a proof-of-concept for such move-by-move analysis and the future use of such
analyses, in experiments like those suggested in Section \ref{sec:discussion} or
in very different work, seems a good investment of research time and effort.
