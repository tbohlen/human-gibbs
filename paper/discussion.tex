\section*{Discussion}

More full discussion of the results, with more allowances for speculative
analysis.  Potential directions for future work.  Unanswered questions

Since each pixel is directly treated as a feature, the assumption of
independence of the features does not fit well with how human beings will
perceive images.  This could be remedied by performing feature extraction on the
pixelated images, and passing the extracted features the particle filter.  The
feature extraction could be designed such that feature independence assumption
would safely be valid for humans. Alternatively, the likelihood model could be
modified to account for possible covariance between dimensions.
